    "In this notebook we provide a Julia-based implementation of the Competitor-aware Shared Vehicle Positioning (CSVP) Framework as developed and outlined in the research paper __\"Data-driven competitor-aware positioning in on-demand vehicle rental networks\"__. The below basic implementation is intended to facilitate replication and benchmark analyses of the presented research. \n",
