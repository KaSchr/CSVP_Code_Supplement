# Code and Data Supplement for Research Paper entitled "Data-driven competitor-aware positioning in on-demand vehicle rental networks"

## Description
This repository contains comprehensive data and code samples to facilitate replication and benchmark analyses based on the research paper entitled "Data-driven competitor-aware positioning in on-demand vehicle rental networks". In particular it contains (1) sample real-world data for xxxx, (2) Julia code of the optimization model and (3) Julia code of the simulation framework.

For ease of use, all code has been compiled into a single jupyter notebook (.ipynb) with extensive annotations and descriptions.

## Instructions
